why would you do this to yourself?
# To Install
```
pip install SpeechRecognition
pip install pyttsx3
pip install openai
pip install keyboard
pip install pydub
pip install requests
winget install ffmpeg
```
If your not on windows use instead of winget
```
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg libavcodec-extra
```
then just run Word.py, that's the only file you need.
